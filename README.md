Use at your own risk!
This is my first wordpress plugin, and it's been done quite fast. 
It's a simple widget that searches the entire catalog and returns a list of elements matching the title.

Setup guide
-----------
Install, go to Appearance -> Widgets menu, and you'll see 'CataBlog Search' as a new available widget.
